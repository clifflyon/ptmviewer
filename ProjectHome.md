HP Labs developed Polynomial Texture Mapping (PTM) as a way of increasing the photorealism of texture maps.  Coefficients of a biquadratic polynomial stored per texel are used to reconstruct the surface color under varying lighting conditions.  Like bump mapping, this allows the perception of surface deformations. However, the PTM method is image-based, and photographs of a surface under varying lighting conditions can be used to construct these maps. Unlike bump maps, Polynomial Texture Maps (PTMs) also capture variations due to surface self-shadowing and interreflections, which enhance realism.  This is a port of the original HP Labs code to Java, which enables the viewing of PTMs over the web.
